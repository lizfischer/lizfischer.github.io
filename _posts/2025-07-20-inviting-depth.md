Certain vibes have always been central to the Derelict experience: uncertainty, suspense, off-beat humor, the 
satisfaction of effective teamwork. But a board game can’t be built on vibes alone<!--more-->. At the same time, an
*over*complex rulebook runs the risk of making things a slog and sapping the spontaneity that a ghost ship game demands. 
As we’ve iterated on *Derelict*, Liz and I have strived to find a happy medium: gameplay mechanics that offer room for 
experimentation and creativity without impeding the exhilaration of exploring the unknown.

To this end, we have sought out intuitive core mechanics from which complexity can emerge contextually. For instance, 
our rules on finding, storing, and using items are fairly straightforward when considered on their own — the complexity
comes from the many potential *interactions* of these items with one another, with the ship’s rooms, and with various 
characters.

By ensuring the basic mechanics are as approachable as possible, we invite players to wade into the nuances of *Derelict*
at their own pace, experimenting with different characters, builds, synergies, and strategies with a minimum of 
hand-holding and prescriptivism from our side. We’re excited to hear about the experiences that emerge at your table!
